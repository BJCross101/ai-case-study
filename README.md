# Anthropic AI

## Overview and Origin

* Anthropic

* The company was incorporated in February of 2021. 

* The company was founded by Dario Amodei, Daniela Amodei, and Jack Clark. Other key figures for Anthropic are Tom Brown and Greg Bockman.

* Anthropic had its beginning at Open AI. Their core beliefs on the advancements of AI led the team to create Anthropic. The leaders of Anthropic believe that the AI revolution will be bigger than the industrial revolution but have more underlying  dangers. This understanding of the potential threats of AI spurred the formation of [Anthropic.](https://www.anthropic.com/news/core-views-on-ai-safety)

        * Claude Pro: $20 US per month
   
    * Cloud Computing:
        * Some investors, such as Microsoft and Amazon, have provided cloud computing credits to Anthropic in exchange for equity.   
        * These credits allow Anthropic to access the computational resources needed to train and operate large language models like Claude.

* They have raised over [$750 million](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/21/openai-rival-anthropic-in-talks-to-raise-750-million-funding-round.html#:~:text=The%20round%20would%20value%20Anthropic,in%20the%20startup%20over%20time) across multiple funding rounds as of Dec 2023.

## Business Activities

* The goal of Anthropic is to develop Safe and Reliable AI systems. They understand the coming wave of AI and they are trying to create a product that benefits people and prevents harm.

* The main goals and problems Anthropic is trying to address are:

    * Developing safe and ethical artificial intelligence systems that are highly capable but also robustly aligned with human values and interests. The key challenge is creating AI that remains reliably beneficial as it becomes more advanced and avoids negative unintended consequences.
    * Making technical breakthroughs in machine learning, especially in areas like natural language processing, reasoning, multi-task learning, and open-ended learning. The aim is to create AI systems with more general and flexible intelligence that can tackle complex, open-ended tasks.
    * Expanding humanity's fundamental understanding of intelligence and cognition by developing AI systems that can shed light on these deep questions through their capabilities and inner workings.
    * Lowering the risks and downsides from advanced AI systems, by exploring technical and strategic solutions for robust AI alignment, transparency, interpretability, and controllability.
    * So in summary, Anthropic is aiming to push forward the frontiers of capable and safe AI while addressing the big open challenges of reliably beneficial and aligned artificial intelligence. I hope this overview is helpful for your case study! Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions.

* The intended customer of Anthropic is humanity as a whole. They want to create AI products that help everyone both in advancement and safety. 
* With the intended market being humanity as a whole you can concluded they are aiming to better [each life within the world](https://www.commerce.gov/news/blog/2024/01/census-bureau-projects-us-and-world-populations-new-years-day#:~:text=The%20projected%20world%20population%20on,the%20U.S.%20and%20world%20populations), an estimated 8 Billion lives. 

* Their competitive differences are as follows 
    1. Strong Focus on AI Alignment
    2. Multi-task, open-ended learning
    3. Transparent and interperable
    4. Constitutional AI
    5. Engaging AI assistant. 

* Currently there is not a listed "unfair" advantage to Anthropic but as one of the leading AI companies, its relationships has allowed it to have access to much larger amounts of data to train their algorithms, as well as access to some of the strongest computation capabilities.

### Core Technologies:

* Large Language Models (LLMs): Anthropic is primarily known for its LLMs, particularly "Claude" and "Instruct." These are massive neural networks trained on vast amounts of text and code, allowing them to generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way (like I am doing now!).
* Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow and PyTorch are likely used to build and train these LLMs, as they are popular choices in the deep learning community.
* Transformers: This specific neural network architecture is a cornerstone of modern LLMs, and Anthropic likely employs it for its efficiency and effectiveness.
* Scaling Laws: Anthropic actively researches how to scale AI systems safely and efficiently. This likely involves studying the relationships between data, compute, parameters, and performance of LLMs.
* Safety and Alignment: Anthropic places a strong emphasis on developing safe and aligned AI, meaning these AI systems should be helpful, beneficial, and not harmful. They have published research papers on this topic and likely utilize various techniques to assess and mitigate potential risks.

Additional Technologies (Based on Job Postings and News Articles):

* Cloud Infrastructure: Anthropic has partnered with Amazon Web Services (AWS) for their primary cloud provider. This likely includes utilizing AWS Trainium and Inferentia chips for training and deploying their LLMs.
* Machine Learning Operations (MLOps): Efficiently managing and deploying LLMs requires robust MLOps practices. Anthropic likely uses tools and methodologies to streamline these processes.
* Research Tools: Various research tools and libraries are likely used for data analysis, visualization, and experimentation. This could include libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
* Systems Programming: Building and maintaining large-scale systems requires expertise in systems programming languages like C++ and Python.

    * The number of GPUs and TPUs used to train Claude have not been disclosed.

    * It will need utilize Amazon's datat to stay competitive with Google, who holds essentially the world’s data through all of its platforms.
    * As well as compete against the notoriety of Open AI and its backing with Microsoft.

## Recommendations

* How I would recommend Anthropic strive for a competitive edge.
    * While Google and Open AI Zig, I recommend Anthropic Zags. To try and compete with Google and the vast data they have would be an uphill battle. Let Google and Open AI have that battle as they focus on market share of subscribers.
    * Instead focus on what Amazon does well and expand on it.
    * Give every Amazon Plus member access to Claude Pro
	    * This would grow user base organically and make Claude the potential household name.
    * Use all Logistical Data from Amazon and create a Vertical stronghold when it comes to AI Logistical prowess and execution. 
    * Partner with the Tesla Organization and its sister companies to create autonomous vehicles that further benefit your Logistical presence and power. 
    * Designate a team to create Agents that are proprietary to AWS that strengthen its offer and lure more enterprise users.

* I believe this would be beneficial to Anthropic becuase of the following reasons.
    * It focuses on their strengths and leverages the footholds that their main investor has in the marketplace.
    * Increased worldwide income, which raises the tide for all ships. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
    * The continued use and development of their LLM Claude and Data collection from all Amazon Prime users that interact with the model
    * Complex AI Agents for their AWS.
    * Video Data collection tech attached to all Amazon vehicles. Benefiting Tesla and Automated Vehicles partnership.
    * Computing Chips to continue to grow computing power and usage capabilities of their services.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
    * Free Claude for Amazon users would produce more use data to better help develop the LLM. (Eventually leading to more purchases both for Amazon Retail Services and Enterprise Services)
    * AI Agents in AWS would bring more users, in turn more data.
    * Video Data and Driver Analytics are needed to crack autonomous driving. Tesla is the current leader. Collecting this data from their large fleet and partnering with Tesla would be a great addition.
    * Chip Wars! To get where everyone is aiming right now with AI, we need more computing power. Anthropic needs to invest heavily to ensure they have their share of the available computing power.
