## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
•	While Google and Open AI Zig, I recommend Anthropic Zags. To try and compete with Google and the vast data they have would be an uphill battle. Let Google and Open AI have that battle as they focus on market share of subscribers.
•	Instead focus on what Amazon does well and expand on it.
o	Give every Amazon Plus member access to Claude Pro
	To grow user base organically and make Claude the potential household name.
o	Use all Logistical Data from Amazon and create a Vertical stronghold when it comes to AI Logistical prowess and execution. 
o	Partner with the Tesla Organization and its sister companies to create autonomous vehicles that further benefit your Logistical presence and power. 
o	Designate a team to create Agents that are proprietary to AWS that strengthen its offer and lure more enterprise users.
